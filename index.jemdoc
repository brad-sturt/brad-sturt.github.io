== About Me
I joined the [https://www.uic.edu/ University of Illinois Chicago] as an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics in Fall 2020. I received my Ph.D in [http://orc.mit.edu/ Operations Research] from [https://www.mit.edu MIT] in Spring 2020, supervised by [https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/ Dimitris Bertsimas]. Prior to MIT, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign] in [https://ece.illinois.edu/ Computer Engineering] and did summer internships at Google and Facebook.   

My research focuses on the intersection of optimization under uncertainty (stochastic, robust, dynamic) and machine learning, with applications to operations, business analytics, and finance. I am particularly interested in the development and application of data-driven methods to help organizations make better decisions in dynamic environments.  

During graduate school, I received the MIT Sloan Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award (selected once per year by MBA students) and second place in the INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition. I also organized the student-run January class "15.S60 Computing for Statistics and Optimization" in [https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/ 2017], [https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2018/ 2018], and [https://github.com/adelarue/cos_2019 2019].
