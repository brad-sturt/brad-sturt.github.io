== About Me
I am an assistant professor of Information and Decision Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago, which I joined in Fall 2020. I completed my PhD in Operations Research from MIT in Spring 2020. Prior to that, I graduated with highest honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a BS in Computer Engineering and a minor in Technology and Management.

My research interest is optimization under uncertainty with focus on applications in operations, revenue management, and the public sector. Recent applications have included election security, data-driven assortment planning and pricing, options pricing, and refugee resettlement. I am also broadly interested in using robust optimization to design tractable approaches for dynamic optimization problems. My work has received several recognitions, including second place in the INFORMS Junior Faculty Interest Group (JFIG) Paper Competition and second place in the INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition.

Outside of academia, I am a co-founder of BallotIQ, an election administration startup.
