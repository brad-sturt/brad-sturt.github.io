<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor of business analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago, which I joined in Fall 2020. I completed my PhD in Operations Research from MIT in Spring 2020. Prior to that, I graduated with highest honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a BS in Computer Engineering and a minor in Technology and Management.</p>
<p>My research interest is <i>optimization under uncertainty</i> with focus on applications in operations, revenue management, and the public sector. I am also broadly interested in using robust optimization to design tractable approaches for dynamic optimization problems.  My work has received several recognitions, including second place in the INFORMS Junior Faculty Interest Group (JFIG) Paper Competition and second place in the INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition.</p>
<p>At UIC, I teach MBA and undergraduate classes on operations management and business analytics. As a graduate student, I received the MIT Sloan Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award (selected once per year by MBA students) and co-organized a student-run class on software tools for statistics and optimization.</p>
