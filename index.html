<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My research uses the methodologies of stochastic programming and robust optimization to develop solutions for operational problems in business and government. I study emerging problems in elections administration as well as fundamental problems in revenue management and dynamic optimization. Recent applications include election security, data-driven assortment planning, high-dimensional option pricing, and robust inventory control.
</p>
<p>My work has been recognized by several research awards, including the Roger J-B Wets Junior Researcher Best Paper Prize in Stochastic Programming, second place in the INFORMS Junior Faculty Interest Group Paper Competition, second place in the INFORMS George Nicholson Student Paper Competition, and the MIT Operations Research Center Best Student Paper Prize. 
</p>
<p>I joined the University of Illinois Chicago as an assistant professor of Information and Decision Sciences in Fall 2020. I received my PhD degree in Operations Research from MIT in 2020 and my Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign in 2014.
</p>
<p>Outside of academia, I am a co-founder of BallotIQ, an elections administration startup.
